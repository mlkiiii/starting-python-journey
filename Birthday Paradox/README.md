# 🎂 Birthday Paradox Simulator – Python Mini Game

My first probability simulation project in Python 🚀  

This program simulates the **Birthday Paradox**, a famous probability problem that shows how surprisingly small groups of people can have matching birthdays.

## 📚 What Is the Birthday Paradox?

The **Birthday Paradox** states that in a group of just 23 people, there is about a 50% chance that at least two people share the same birthday.

This project simulates that concept by:

1. Generating random birthdays for a group of people.
2. Checking if at least two people share the same birthday.
3. Running 100,000 simulations.
4. Calculating the probability of a shared birthday.

## 🎮 How The Program Works

### Step 1:
The user enters the number of people in the group (between 2 and 100).

### Step 2:
The program generates random birthdays.

### Step 3:
It checks if at least two birthdays match.

### Step 4:
It runs 100,000 simulations to calculate the probability.

## 🧠 Example Output
Welcome to the Birthday Paradox!
This program simulates the birthday paradox.
Enter the number of people in the group: 23
Jan 5,
Mar 19,
Aug 2,
...
--snip--
...
Generating 23 random birthdays 1000 times...
press enter to run 100000 simulations...
0 simulations run...
1 simulations run...

--snip--
...
Out of 100000 simulations, 50712 had at least one shared birthday.
That means that in a group of 23 people, there is a 50.712% chance that two people share a birthday.
That's probably higher than you expected!
