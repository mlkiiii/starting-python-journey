# 🥯 Bagels – Python Mini Game

My first Python project 🎉  

**Bagels** is a simple deductive logic game built in Python where the player tries to guess a secret three-digit number generated randomly by the computer.

## 🎮 How The Game Works

The computer randomly generates a **3-digit number (100–999)**.

You try to guess the number.

After each guess, the game gives you clues:

- **Fermi** → A digit is correct and in the correct position.
- **Pico** → A digit is correct but in the wrong position.
- **Bagels** → No digits are correct.

The game continues until you guess the number correctly.

## 🧠 Example Gameplay
Welcome to Bagels, a deductive logic game.
I am thinking of a three-digit number. Try to guess what it is.
Enter your guess: 123
Pico
Fermi
Enter your guess: 456
Bagels
Enter your guess: 789
Congratulations! You guessed the number!
