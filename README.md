# 🚀 Starting Python Journey

Welcome to my public learning repository.

This repository documents my complete journey of learning Python — from absolute beginner to advanced, project-based development.

The goal of this repository is simple:

✔ Build consistently  
✔ Share progress publicly  
✔ Improve through real projects  
✔ Grow from Zero → Hero
