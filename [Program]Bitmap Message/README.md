# 🖼️ Bitmap Message – Python Mini Program

My first creative Python text project 🚀  

**Bitmap Message** is a simple Python program that takes a multi-line text pattern and fills it with a custom message, creating a cool “bitmap-style” text effect.

---

## 📖 What This Program Does

1. The user enters multiple lines of text (a shape or pattern).
2. The user enters a custom message.
3. The program replaces every non-space character in the pattern with characters from the message.
4. The message repeats automatically if it is shorter than the pattern.

This creates a fun visual text effect.

## 🧠 Example Usage

### User Input Pattern:
****
* *
****
### Message:
HELLO
### Output:
HELL
O H
ELLO

The message loops to fill the shape!

## 🎮 How It Works

- The program collects multiple lines until the user presses Enter on an empty line.
- It reads a custom message from the user.
- It replaces each non-space character in the pattern with letters from the message.
- When the message reaches the end, it starts again from the beginning.
